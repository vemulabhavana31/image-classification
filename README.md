# Image Classification using CNN

This project implements an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained to classify images into different categories using deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Utilizes CNN for image classification
- Processes and augments image datasets
- Implements model training and evaluation
- Uses TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images. You can use publicly available datasets like CIFAR-10, MNIST, or a custom dataset.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification-cnn.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd image-classification-cnn
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Image Classification (CNN).ipynb"
```

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to classify images.

## Results
The model is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics. The trained model can be fine-tuned for better performance.

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute by improving the model, optimizing hyperparameters, or experimenting with different datasets.
